Both extensions are not optimized to create very small images and they are quite slow. They also lack support for newer image formats like avif (PHP 8.1 will have avif in gd). The PHP community has build packages (like spatie/image-optimizer) to optimize an image after it has been uploaded by executing several optimziers in the CLI. This approach requires to have functions like exec, system or proc_open available, which are disabled by default on some shared hosters. Also, the optimizers need to be installed on the host system. But there are new technologies like ffi or wasm available in PHP.\nImage generation using FFI / WASM on server-side Instead of requiring optimizers installed on the server system, we could bring it with the code, isolated as WASM or as a shared library with FFI. These approaches are both very fast, but unfortunately, both technologies are not widely used in the PHP ecosystem.\nPre optimize the images before uploading on client side Since the WASM support has landed in the browsers, it is also possible to optimize the image before sending it to the servers. This approach added Discourse to their platform to reduce the file size of uploaded images. This will work good in a situation where the Administration only manages the entire shop. Still, most users are using the API or Import extensions to import the products with the images. There will be client-side optimization not help as the optimization happens inside the browser.\nLetting a external service do our image processing When we can’t create the best optimized image with just plain PHP, why not let our image processing work be done by some external service? One of my favourite image processing systems is imgproxy. It can be even selfhosted, if necessary. We save the original images on the server or an external storage like S3 and just link it to our image processing server with some parameters, like width, height etc. The servers are doing the rest for us with the best possible image results. Such servers also offer better image formats if the browser supports it. This means, when the browser requests a jpg image, but the browser supports also webp. The server can respond to the .jpg file extension a webp image without even providing multiple links or using a picture element. It’s important that your used processing service does cache your requests or you will have to setup a own CDN before it. Let’s do a quick pros and cons list of the usage of such software:\nPros:\n Best possible optimized image Serving better image formats as the original image (jpg = webp) without doing anything special Smaller backups of the shop, as we don’t have to save thumbnails  Can be even smaller when the original images are saved on a cloud bucket   Can be self-hosted, if necessary We can be flexible in our template and use the dimension we want instead blowing up your storage Improves the global access times with some cloud image processing  This mostly requires that the original image are also saved on their network    Cons:\n When the image processing service is offline, images in our shop cannot be loaded When the original images are saved in a cloud bucket and we don’t make backups, our deleted file will be gone The choosen service needs caching so we should setup a cdn before your processing service  How do we integrate such external service in our shopware shops? Unfortunately, Shopware does not support the usage of an external service by default. But the guys from FriendsOfShopware has covered us with the Thumbnail processor plugin. This extension is free and can be installed from Shopware store or from Github. Special thanks there to tinect the author of the extension.\nWhat does the plugin for us?\n Disabling the Shopware own thumbnail generation Allows us to define a URL template how the storefront url needs to be generated  A template looks like: https://mycdn.shopdomain.com/{mediaPath}?width={width}\u0026height={height}   Adds lazy image loading to the storefront Takes automatically care of the sizes attribute for responsive images  With the usage of an cloud-bucket like s3 we can even move the original files from disk to the bucket. For this refer to the Shopware documentation on how to accomplish that.\nSome image processing providers list  BunnyCDN  not cheap with 9,5$/m per zone for image processing, but fast and including webp. We need to enable Bunny Optimizer and Manipulation Engine. Additionally, we can use really cheap storage and global traffic.   imgproxy  Opensource, can be selfhosted, fast and including webp and avif. But needs a caching in front of it, f.e. a CDN.   Images.weserv.nl  Free, slow and not including webp   cloudimage  Has free plan, fast and including webp   Cloudflare  Only available at Business plan    Conclusion Thumbnails are essential in modern web development. But do we really want wasting time for setting up PHP with libavif, installing optimizers on the host to optimize later after upload the images and still getting unsuitable images for our users and pagespeed? I am sure there are better tasks to do as these. The external services are even very cheap like with Bunnycdn for 9,5$. Give it a try and keep focusing on the things that really needs your power.\n","wordCount":"924","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2021-07-14T00:15:59Z","dateModified":"2021-07-14T00:15:59Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Shyim"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://shyim.me/blog/thumbnails-and-php/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Shyim's Brain","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6224096?s=460\u0026u=18be3a2d46f07dd42fc2b6dee9b4b9b68bca28d2\u0026v=4"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><noscript><style type=text/css>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://shyim.me/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src="https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6224096?s=460&u=18be3a2d46f07dd42fc2b6dee9b4b9b68bca28d2&v=4" alt=logo aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a>
